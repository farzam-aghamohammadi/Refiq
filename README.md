# Refiq
Rafiq is a decentralized social media platform where users create unique NFT topics and set moderation policies. Users can engage by creating posts, commenting, and rewarding content with Eth.

Rafiq uses the [web3j](https://docs.web3j.io/4.11.0/) for creating the wallet, interacting with smart contracts, and signing the transactions on the Ethereum network.

The content data is stored and retrieved decentralized with the help of [Filecoin's web3.storage](https://web3.storage/).

Rafiq is searching and exploring the topic's name by taking advantage of the [Graph](https://thegraph.com/) API(GraphQL).
